## Dynamic Vertex Replacement Grammar

# Acknowledgements
This is the result of a collaboration with Grant Boquet and Timothy La Fond
from the Lawrence-Livermore National Laboratory.
This work is based on the `Modeling Graphs with Vertex Replacement Grammars`
[paper][cnrgpaper] and [code base][cnrgcode] by S. Sikdar *et al.*,
wherein the `Clustering-based Node Replacement Grammar` (CNRG) was introduced.

Thanks to: Zachariah Carmichael for his help proof-reading and his helpful feedback;
Justus Hibhsman for his stimulating discussions and brilliant suggestions;
the eternal patience of my advisor Tim Weninger.

P.S.: the `requirements.txt` and `packages.txt` may not be up to date; these will be updated in the near future.
